    <li>
      <p>1 (5 ounce) can evaporated milk</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>2 eggs, well beaten</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>2 cups whole milk</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed Cheddar cheese soup (such as Campbell's®)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>1 pinch paprika, or as desired (Optional)</p>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in macaroni and return to a boil.
        Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and
        transfer pasta to a slow cooker.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Add butter to pasta and stir until melted; season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle about 1/2 of the Cheddar
        cheese
        over pasta and stir.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Whisk evaporated milk and eggs together in a bowl until smooth; stir into pasta mixture.</p>

  <h2>Tips</h2>
  <p>Some slow cookers take less time. Check the edges are not getting too brown after 2 1/2 hours.</p>
  <p>To bake in a conventional oven, pour pasta mixture into a casserole dish and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)
    for 45 minutes to 1 hour.</p>
